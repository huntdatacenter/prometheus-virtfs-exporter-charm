# <a id="jobrequest"></a>`class JobRequest(BaseRequest)`

Base class for requests using the request / response pattern.

Subclasses **must** set the ``RESPONSE_CLASS`` attribute to a subclass of
the :class:`BaseResponse` which defines the fields that the response will
use.  They must also define additional attributes as :class:`Field`s.

For example::

    class TLSResponse(BaseResponse):
        key = Field('Private key for the cert')
        cert = Field('Public cert info')


    class TLSRequest(BaseRequest):
        RESPONSE_CLASS = TLSResponse

        common_name = Field('Common Name (CN) for the cert to be created')
        sans = Field('List of Subject Alternative Names (SANs)')
